{"id":"maggie-00m","title":"Implement AOT compilation for Maggie bytecode","description":"Compile Maggie bytecode to native code ahead-of-time, eliminating interpreter overhead.\n\nApproach options:\n1. Generate Go code from bytecode → compile with `go build` (simplest)\n2. Generate LLVM IR → use LLVM backend\n3. Generate native assembly directly (most complex)\n\nRecommended: Option 1 (Go codegen) - leverage existing Go toolchain.\n\nFor each bytecode method, generate a Go function that performs the same operations directly. The generated code would look like:\n\n```go\nfunc CompiledMethod_Lexer_nextToken(vm *VM, self Value, args []Value) Value {\n    // Direct Go code instead of bytecode interpretation\n    temp0 := self.GetIvar(0)  // instead of PUSH_IVAR 0\n    temp1 := vm.Send(temp0, \"peek\", nil)  // instead of SEND\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- No interpreter dispatch overhead\n- Go compiler optimizes the generated code\n- Native performance for compiled methods\n\nDeliverables:\n- BytecodeToGo translator\n- Integration with build process\n- Benchmark showing speedup","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"chazbone@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T17:06:18.306653-05:00","created_by":"chazu","updated_at":"2026-01-22T18:32:22.889695-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-22T18:32:22.889695-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented AOT compiler with bytecode-to-Go translation, VM integration, and benchmarks"}

When a block accesses variables from the enclosing method scope (e.g., [i := i + 1] in a whileTrue: loop), the block can't find those variables and falls back to treating them as globals.\n\nThe TODO in visitBlockNode: says 'Handle captures properly'. Need to:\n1. Track outer scope temps when compiling nested blocks\n2. Use OpPushHomeTemp/OpStoreHomeTemp for method-level temp access from blocks\n3. Or implement proper capture mechanism with OpCaptureTemp\n\nThis causes whileTrue: loops with variable updates to fail - the loop runs but variable updates don't persist.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chazbone@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T14:44:43.286109-05:00","created_by":"chazu","updated_at":"2026-01-22T15:12:06.665386-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-22T15:12:06.665386-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed by moving selector to method scope and fixing Go compiler's STORE_CAPTURED handling","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"maggie-6fy","depends_on_id":"maggie-909","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-01-22T14:44:55.068646-05:00","created_by":"chazu"}]}

Non-local returns are relatively rare (only explicit ^ in blocks)\n2. The 100-500ns overhead is negligible compared to interpreter dispatch\n3. Correctness and simplicity outweigh micro-optimization\n4. A return stack would add complexity to every block invocation path\n\n**When to reconsider**: If profiling shows non-local return as a hotspot (unlikely), or if implementing a tracing JIT where panic/recover would interfere with optimization.\n\nThe current implementation is well-designed with proper goroutine boundary checking and frame validity validation."}

The types being encoded (strings, dictionaries) are frequently created and benefit from avoiding heap allocation\n2. The cascading checks are O(1) in practice (constant number of types)\n3. Converting to object pointers would require heap allocation for every string/dictionary creation\n\n**Suggested optimization**: Create a type-tag lookup table at VM init that maps high symbol IDs to vtables, replacing cascading if-else with a single table lookup:\n\n```go\nfunc (i *Interpreter) vtableFor(v Value) *VTable {\n    if v.IsSymbol() {\n        id := v.SymbolID()\n        if vt := i.symbolTypeVTables[id\u003e\u003e48]; vt != nil {\n            return vt\n        }\n    }\n    // ... rest of dispatch\n}\n```\n\nThis would be a medium-priority optimization if profiling shows vtableFor as a hotspot."}
